Josh Seiden is a product consultant and author who has just released a book called Outcomes Over Output. Brian is product management director and he's looking forward to the chat. The main premise of the book is that by defining outcomes precisely, it's possible to apply this idea of outcomes in our work. It's in contrast to a really broad and undefined definition of the word ”outcome”. Paul, one of the design managers at Intercom, was struggling to differentiate between customer outcomes and business impact. In Lean Startup, teams focus on what they can change in their behavior to make their customers more satisfied. They focus on the business impact instead of on the customer outcomes. They have a hypothesis and they test their hypothesis with an experiment. They don't have to be 100% certain, but they need to have a hunch. There is a difference between problem-focused and outcome-focused approaches to building and prioritizing projects. For example, a company is working on improving the inbox search feature in their product. They hope it will improve user retention and improve the business impact of the change. Product teams need to focus on the outcome of their work rather than on the business impact of their product. They need to be more aware of the customer experience and their relationship with their business. As a business owner, you have to build a theory of how the business works. The more you know about your business as your business goes on, the more you can build a business model. The business model is reflected in roadmaps and prioritizations. Josh's book is available on Amazon, in print, in ebook and in audiobook on Audible.com.
